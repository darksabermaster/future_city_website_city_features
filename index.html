In our city, we have universities teaching marine biology and marine architecture. Surfing events are prevalent in our city. The average day of a citizen will consist of waking up in their house and eating breakfast either at home through purchased goods or going to one of many restaurants. After this, they will bike to work at their job. They will bike home from work at 4:00. Dinner will consist of either brand products or food grown on the island. Hydro Perth has a tile specially built for surfing, American football, and soccer. The city is a warm paradise, with hotels and restaurants on the coast to create income.
